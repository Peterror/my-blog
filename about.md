Hi! 

My name is Piotr and I love programming, robotics and AI. 
Since i remember I'm interested in understanding how things work. 
I enjoy sharing my knowledge, that's why I came up with this blog and so I'm taking part in student clubs activities. In AI club I'm a president and in robotics club (Martian Rover Project) I'm a participant. 

If you've got any questions, my social media are below. 

I hope you enjoy my blog :)
